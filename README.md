## Mice & Mystics App
https://github.com/mkazmer/mice-mystics-app2.0

This app is designed to be used with the board game Mice & Mystics. (https://www.plaidhatgames.com/games/mice-and-mystics)

I created the app as the board game requires a lot of dice rolling for the minions you encounter throught the game.  Instead of doing this manually, you can use the app to calculate these roll with a single click.
